Constipation is a common condition that affects people of all ages. It can mean that you're not passing stools regularly or you're unable to completely empty your bowel.
Constipation can also cause your stools to be hard and lumpy, as well as unusually large or small.
The severity of constipation varies from person to person. Many people only experience constipation for a short time, but for others, constipation can be a long-term (chronic) condition that causes significant pain and discomfort and affects quality of life.
What causes constipation?
It's often difficult to identify the exact cause of constipation. However, there are a number of things that contribute to the condition, including:
•	not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals
•	a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits
•	ignoring the urge to pass stools
•	side effects of certain medications
•	not drinking enough fluids
•	anxiety or depression
In children, poor diet, fear about using the toilet and problems toilet training can all lead to constipation.
Who's affected
Constipation can occur in babies, children and adults. It's estimated that around 1 in every 7 adults and up to 1 in every 3 children in the UK has constipation at any one time.
The condition affects twice as many women as men and is also more common in older adults and during pregnancy.
When to see your General Practitioner
You may be able to treat constipation yourself by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle (see below). If these changes don't help and the problem continues, you should see your General Practitioner.
Also speak to your General Practitioner if you think your child might be constipated.
Treating constipation
Diet and lifestyle changes are usually recommended as the first treatment for constipation.
This includes gradually increasing your daily intake of fibre, making sure you drink plenty of fluids, and trying to get more exercise.
If these aren't effective, your General Practitioner may prescribe an oral laxative medication that can help you empty your bowels.
Treatment for constipation is effective, although in some cases it can take several months before a regular bowel pattern is re-established.
Preventing constipation
Making the diet and lifestyle changes mentioned above can also help to reduce your risk of developing constipation in the first place.
Giving yourself enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably may also help, and you should try not to ignore the urge to go to the toilet.
Complications
For most people constipation rarely causes complications, but people with long-term constipation can develop:
•	haemorrhoids (piles)
•	faecal impaction (where dry, hard stools collect in the rectum)
•	bowel incontinence (the leakage of liquid stools)

Symptoms
When you're constipated, passing stools becomes more difficult and less frequent than usual.
Normal bowel habits vary from person to person. Some adults go to the toilet more than once a day, whereas others may only go every 3 or 4 days. Similarly, some infants pass stools several times a day, while others only pass them a few times a week.
If you or your child pass stools less than usual, it could be a sign of constipation.
It may also be more difficult to pass stools and you may feel unable to empty your bowel completely. Your stools may appear dry, hard and lumpy, as well as abnormally large or small.
Other symptoms of constipation can include:
•	stomach ache and cramps
•	feeling bloated
•	feeling sick
•	loss of appetite
Constipation in children
As well as infrequent or irregular bowel movements, a child with constipation may also have any of the following symptoms:
•	loss of appetite
•	a lack of energy
•	being irritable, angry or unhappy
•	foul-smelling wind and stools
•	stomach pain and discomfort
•	soiling their clothes
•	generally feeling unwell
When to see your General Practitioner
You may be able to treat constipation yourself by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle. However, you should see your General Practitioner if these changes don't help.
You should also see your General Practitioner for advice if you notice any rectal bleeding, unexplained weight loss or persistent tiredness.
Take your child to see your General Practitioner if you think they are constipated. Laxatives are often recommended for children alongside diet and lifestyle changes.
Causes
Constipation usually occurs when stools remain in the colon (large intestine) for too long, and the colon absorbs too much water from the stools, causing them to become hard and dry.
Most cases of constipation aren't caused by a specific condition and it may be difficult to identify the exact cause. However, several factors can increase your chances of having constipation, including:
•	not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals
•	a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits
•	having limited privacy when using the toilet
•	ignoring the urge to pass stools
•	immobility or lack of exercise
•	not drinking enough fluids
•	having a high temperature (fever)
•	being underweight or overweight
•	anxiety or depression
•	psychiatric problems, such as those brought on by sexual abuse, violence or trauma
Medication
Constipation may sometimes be a side effect of a medicine you're taking. Common types of medication that can cause constipation include:
•	aluminium antacids (medicine to treat indigestion)
•	antidepressants
•	antiepileptics (medicine to treat epilepsy)
•	antipsychotics (medicine to treat schizophrenia and other mental health conditions)
•	calcium supplements
•	opiate painkillers, such as codeine and morphine
•	diuretics (water tablets)
•	iron supplements
If constipation is caused by medication, the condition will usually ease once you stop taking the medicine. However, you shouldn't stop taking any prescribed medication unless your General Practitioner advises you to.
Speak to your General Practitioner if you have constipation that's caused by a medicine. They may be able to prescribe an alternative.
Pregnancy
About 2 in every 5 women experience constipation during their pregnancy, mostly during the early stages.
Constipation occurs during pregnancy because your body produces more of the female hormone progesterone, which acts as a muscle relaxant.
The bowel normally moves stools and waste products to the anus by a process known as peristalsis. This is when the muscles lining the bowel contract and relax in a rippling, wave-like motion. An increase in progesterone makes it more difficult for the bowel muscles to contract, making it harder to move waste products along.
If you're pregnant, there are ways to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Read more about treating constipation.
Other conditions
In rare cases, constipation can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as:
•	irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
•	diabetes
•	hypercalcaemia – where there's too much calcium in the bloodstream
•	underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)
•	muscular dystrophy – a genetic condition that causes muscle wasting
•	multiple sclerosis – a condition that affects the nervous system
•	Parkinson's disease – where part of the brain becomes progressively damaged, affecting the co-ordination of body movements
•	spinal cord injury
•	anal fissure – a small tear or ulcer in the skin just inside the anus
•	inflammatory bowel disease – a condition that causes the intestines to become inflamed (irritated and swollen)
•	bowel cancer
Babies and children
Constipation in babies and children is quite common. It's estimated that up to 1 in every 3 children in the UK has constipation at any time. Poor diet, fear about using the toilet and poor toilet training can all be responsible.
Poor diet
Children who are over-fed are more likely to have constipation, as are those who don't get enough fluids. Babies who have too much milk are also more likely to get constipation. As with adults, it's very important that your child has enough fibre in their diet.
Toilet training
It's important that you don't make your child feel stressed or pressured about using the toilet. It's also important to let your children try things by themselves (when appropriate). Constantly intervening when they're using the toilet may make them feel anxious and may contribute to constipation.
Toilet habits
Some children can feel stressed or anxious about using the toilet. They may have a phobia about using the toilet, or feel they are unable to use the toilets at school.
This fear may be the result of your child experiencing pain when passing stools. This can lead to poor bowel habits, where children ignore the urge to pass stools and instead withhold them for fear of experiencing pain and discomfort. However, if they do this, their condition will only get worse.
Other conditions
In rare cases, constipation in babies and children can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as:
•	Hirschsprung's disease – which affects the bowel, making it difficult to pass stools
•	anorectal malformation – where the baby's anus and rectum don't form properly
•	spinal cord abnormalities – including rare conditions such as spina bifida and cerebral palsy
•	cystic fibrosis – a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick and sticky mucus, which can lead to constipation

Prevention
There are a number of things you can do to prevent constipation, including making diet and lifestyle changes.
Fibre
Including enough fibre in your diet can significantly reduce your chances of developing constipation. Most adults don't eat enough fibre.
You should aim to have about 30g of fibre a day. You can increase your fibre intake by eating more:
•	fruit and vegetables
•	wholegrain rice
•	wholewheat pasta
•	wholemeal bread
•	seeds and oats
Eating more fibre will keep your bowel movements regular, because it helps food pass through your digestive system more easily. Foods high in fibre also make you feel fuller for longer.
It's important to increase your fibre intake gradually, because a sudden increase may make you feel bloated. Suddenly increasing your intake of fibre may also cause you to produce more wind (flatulence) and experience stomach cramps.
Fluids
Make sure you drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, and steadily increase your intake when exercising or when it's hot. Try to cut back on the amount of caffeine, alcohol and fizzy drinks you consume.
Toilet habits
Never ignore the urge to go to the toilet, because it can significantly increase your chances of having constipation.
When going to the toilet, make sure you have enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably.
Exercise
Keeping active and mobile will greatly reduce your risk of getting constipation. You should do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week.
As well as regular exercise reducing your risk of becoming constipated, it will also leave you feeling healthier and improve your mood, energy levels and general fitness.
