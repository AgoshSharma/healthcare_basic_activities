Back pain that develops suddenly can be disabling at first, but will usually ease over time.
What to do
If you've developed back pain, or back and leg pain, in the last 48 hours:
•	take painkillers - this can help your pain and help you move
•	apply heat or cold - this can also help your pain
•	keep active - try and keep moving, even if you have to go carefully at first
•	do some back exercises - working out any tension, or stiffness, in your back can help you to keep active
You should also follow this advice if you back pain has got worse.
When to see your General Practitioner
You should speak to your General Practitioner as soon as possible if you have back pain and:
•	find it difficult to pass or control urine
•	feel numbness or altered sensation around your back passage or genitals - such as wiping after the toilet
•	have pins and needles around your back passage or genitals - such as wiping after the toilet
Sitting and standing
If you have back pain, you may find it difficult to get out of bed or get up from a chair or the floor. There are some simple techniques you can use to make this easier and more comfortable.

Back problems
Most back problems start for no obvious reason, which can be very frustrating. The spine is strong and back problems are rarely due to any serious disease or damage.
Back problems can cause a range of symptoms, including:
•	stiffness
•	muscle spasms
•	hot, burning, shooting or stabbing pains in your back and sometimes into one or both of your legs
You may also get pins and needles - this can be due to nerve irritation.
You don't normally need to see a healthcare professional. New or flare-up of longstanding back problems should begin to settle within 6 weeks.
What causes back problems?
Although most back problems start for no obvious reason, back pain can be caused by:
•	staying in one position too long
•	lifting something awkwardly
•	a flare-up of an existing problem
Can this cause problems anywhere else?
Your back problem may cause hot, burning, shooting, or stabbing pains into one or both of your legs. You may also get pins and needles - this can be due to nerve irritation.
Self-help
Keeping active is an essential part of your treatment and recovery and is the single best thing you can do for your health. Exercising can really help your back and reduce the pain you feel.
Try not to:
•	brace or hold yourself still - your back is designed to be mobile
•	sit down or rest for too long - resting in bed doesn't help back pain, and often makes it harder to get going again.
If you have to sit or rest, try to change positions regularly and find one that reduces any pain in your back or legs.
Being physically active throughout your recovery can:
•	prevent a recurrence of the problem
•	maintain your current levels of fitness – even if you have to modify what you normally do, any activity is better than none
•	keep your other muscles and joints strong and flexible
•	help you aim for a healthy body weight
It's recommended you stay at or return to work as quickly as possible during your recovery. You don't need to be pain and symptom-free to return to work.
Advice to help with your pain
The following can help to reduce the pain:
•	Pain medication - this can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery.
•	Heat or ice packs.
•	Tens machine - this is a small battery operated machine that stimulates the skin to help reduce the level of pain you feel. They can be bought from chemists or online.
Speak to your community pharmacist or other healthcare professional about taking medication. It's important to take medication regularly.
Stay positive
It’s easy to start worrying about all the possible things that could be wrong, but research has shown that most back pain settles with time. Keeping as active as possible helps you to cope better and recover more quickly.
Consider your posture
Although your posture doesn’t need to be perfect, resting in poor positions can affect your back problem. Try and move often so you don't get stuck in a poor position for long.
